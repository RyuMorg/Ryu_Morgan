Neuroflow Project


In this project, I was tasked with creating a table using a JSON file filled with data related to albums with the addition of a mock API. However, I was unable to learn how to work with the mock API leading me to create my own Javascript function to create the table. Using my knowledge of Javascript along with the help of Javascript documentation, I was able to produce code that fetches the first values of the JSON file and append the values to my table using vanilla js. However, with developing the project I read into some problems primarily dealing with appending more values to the table in a different row. I was unable to overcome this obstacle, but I believe that my limited knowledge of functions along with helpful Javascript documentation allowed by to truly learn and identify my weaknesses in Javascript.
